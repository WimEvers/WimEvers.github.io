    First Turn-in: Create a Gihub Repository for Project 1. Then post to the Coursera turn-in:
        The URL to your Project 1 GitHub repository, and the URL to your index.html Github Pages live link
        Three screen capture images of successful html validation. One for each website page.

Requirements

    NO CSS IN YOUR HTML FILE!!! This means no style at all. No spacing, no centering, no color, no italics. Just raw html.
    Absolutely no br tags or use of tables for layout. This is also considered style.
    Two spaces indented cascade. Each child element should be indented 2 space right of its parent.
    Three images of HTML validation, one for each page. W3C HTML validator (-50% if it doesn't validate)
    Create a bulleted list at the top of each page. The list items will be the file names of all 3 pages. This is your basic navigation.
    Include at least three HTML images and one other form of media (audio or video)
    Do not use any pre-build code or frameworks. Write it all from scratch.
    Directory-based file structure for links and media. Do not use full URLs when linking to your own content. Example: "css/screen.css" vs. "https://dkriegls.github.io/itmd-361-spring2018/css/screen.css"
    At least 10 commits to your Github repository; with meaningful commit messages that accurately reflect your changes
