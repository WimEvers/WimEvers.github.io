Project Description

Create three HTML pages, each with one desktop size page-scroll worth of content. One of the pages must be your professional resume. The themes of the other two are your choice.

    First Turn-in: Create a Gihub Repository for Project 1. Then post to the Coursera turn-in:
        The URL to your Project 1 GitHub repository, and the URL to your index.html Github Pages live link
        Three screen capture images of successful html validation. One for each website page.

Requirements

    NO CSS IN YOUR HTML FILE!!! This means no style at all. No spacing, no centering, no color, no italics. Just raw html.
    Absolutely no br tags or use of tables for layout. This is also considered style.
    Two spaces indented cascade. Each child element should be indented 2 space right of its parent.
    Three images of HTML validation, one for each page. W3C HTML validator (-50% if it doesn't validate)
    Create a bulleted list at the top of each page. The list items will be the file names of all 3 pages. This is your basic navigation.
    Include at least three HTML images and one other form of media (audio or video)
    Do not use any pre-build code or frameworks. Write it all from scratch.
    Directory-based file structure for links and media. Do not use full URLs when linking to your own content. Example: "css/screen.css" vs. "https://dkriegls.github.io/itmd-361-spring2018/css/screen.css"
    At least 10 commits to your Github repository; with meaningful commit messages that accurately reflect your changes
    Git repository must contain only the files and commits from this project. Each website you make for this class should have its own repository.

  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>I'm a retired mechanical engineer</p>
  <p>To keep my mind sharp I've learned and used python, access and excel programming to automate some cumbersome list keeping</p>
  <p>I thought it fun to make my own website so now I'm learning just how to do that</p>
  <h3>My activities</h3>
  <p>I am an active reader of Science fiction and Fantasy books (I own some 1800 books and about 2000 booklets (the Perry Rhodan series, not complete however). Some of my favourites: Larry Niven, Django Wexler, John Gwynne, Eric Frank Russel and Raymond Fiest</p>
  <p>I have a vegetable garden (together with a friend) where I grow my organic vegetables. <img src="media/images/garden.png" alt="My vegetable garden" width="400" height="300"></p>
